# Mirrors rendering

This is a small ThreeJS project that contains the code for my article about
mirror rendering which I'm about to write.
The project contains a scene with two mirrors and one cube rotating between them.

### How to run?
```
- npm install
- npm run dev
- go to localhost:3000 in your browser
```

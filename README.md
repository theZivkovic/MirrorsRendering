# Mirrors rendering

This is a small ThreeJS project that contains the code for my article about
projective texture mapping that you can find here: [thezivkovic.com/articles/mirrors-rendering](http://www.thezivkovic.com/articles/mirrors-rendering).

### What you can do with it?

When you run the project you see should a ground, a rotating cube
and three mirrors around it. You can:
- rotate the scene using mouse click&drag
- zoom in/out the scene using mouse wheel

### How to run?
```
- npm install
- npm run dev
- go to localhost:3000 in your browser
```
